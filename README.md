# Randomization-Test
A project where i performed permutation tests comparing 3 treatments using Systematic and Random Permutation
The dataset has 10 data. We have to split this into 3 tratment of size 2,3 and 4. The code randomizationnew.py gives the output of the both systematic and p=random permutation. If you want
to customize the dataset you can do that in the python file. Also all the results of the projects are contained in the pdf file.
